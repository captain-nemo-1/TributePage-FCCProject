        <h3>About her life</h3>
        <div id="tribute-info">
          <p><strong>1910 |<strong> Born in Gubbi Taluk in the Kingdom of Mysore (Present day Tumkur district of Karnataka in India)</p>
          <p><strong>1928 |<strong> Got married to a labourer, Sri Bikkala Chikkayya from Hulikal village.</p>
          <p><strong>1950 |<strong> She wanted to end her life at the age of 40 as she could not conceive children.</p>
          <p>She started planting banyan trees along with her husband, and found a purpose in it.</p>
          <p>Both Thimmakka and her husband started with 10 banyan saplings on either side of the road along a stretch of 4 km in the first year. They took care of the plants just like their children.</p>
          <p>Till date, there have been more than 8000 other trees grown by her and her husband. Growing banyan trees was challenging in a place that was relatively dry.</p>
